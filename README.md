# TODO LIST

 \hello\`

Welcome to the To-Do List project, a comprehensive web application that seamlessly integrates Front-End, Back-End, and Database functionalities.

# CAPABILITIES

Our To-Do List application boasts the following capabilities:

* Add tasks to separate categories: To-Do, Doing, and Done.
* Seamlessly drag and drop tasks between the three categories for better organization.
* Effortlessly delete tasks by dragging them to the trash can icon.

# FRONT-END TECHNOLOGIES

For the front-end development, we utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

# BACK-END TECHNOLOGIES

The back-end of the application is powered by NodeJS and the Express framework. For the view engine, we chose EJS to render dynamic web pages.

# DATABASE

To manage and store our data, we employed MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which perfectly complements the NodeJS environment.
